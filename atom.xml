    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="tmux">Tmux</a> is a terminal multiplexer that has been around for a few years; doing a simple google search you will find some <a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/06/28/tmux-the-terminal-multiplexer/" title="hawkhost article">introductory</a> <a href="http://mutelight.org/articles/practical-tmux" title="Practical tmux">articles</a>.</p>

<p>There are quite a few plugins that create a seamless integration with <code>vim</code>: <a href="https://github.com/sjl/tslime.vim" title="Steve Losh's tslime">tslime</a>, <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/20906204174/vimux-simple-extensible-vim-integration-with-tmux" title="vimux article">vimux</a> and <a href="http://esa-matti.suuronen.org/blog/2012/04/19/slimux-tmux-plugin-for-vim/" title="slimux">slimux</a>. People also use tmux extensively for <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/20986196780/wemux-multi-user-terminal-multiplexing-for-party-pair-pr" title="wemux">remote pair programming</a>.</p>

<p>Tmux is a nicer and more modern alternative to screen. Beside being actively mantained tmux is also extremely configurable and scriptable.</p>

<p>I discovered tmux only recently, mainly thanks to the <a href="http://thechangelog.com/tagged/tmux" title="The Changelog, #tmux">Changelog show</a> and the resulting buzz on the twittersphere. It was only a matter of time before a customized <code>.tmux.conf</code> entered the realms of <a href="http://github.com/grota/rcfiles" title="My rc files">my dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a developer you work on text all day, and you might have a few script or long-running jobs executing in the shell. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s also very likely that you have to constantly switch between those applications.</p>

<p>You might not be aware of that, but constantly switching focus takes a toll on your brain, is a source of distraction, and is a major hindrance towards achieving what us developers crave, a state of mental performance called <strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" title="The Flow, from wikipedia">the flow</a></em></strong>.
If that is case you should know that adopting a workflow based on tmux can reduce a lot of that background stress.<br/>
The most common pattern that emerges, for example, is being able to keep opened, side by side in the same tmux window, two panes: one with the shell and the other with terminal vim.</p>

<p>In the next post I&#8217;ll describe how tmux helped me reduce a lot of the context switch that is major annoyance of mine while working, and a few configuration settings that make working with tmux a pleasure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few people know I am a vim aficionado, and I figured I could share a little bit of my vim knowledge on this blog.
While browsing the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/vim">r/vim subreddit</a> a while ago I found a little piece of vim configuration that lets you have a vertical bar for the cursor in terminal vim, using gnome-terminal as a terminal emulator.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s the snippet, which you can put in your <code>.vimrc</code>, for example.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> has<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;autocmd&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> &amp;&amp; has<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;GUI_GTK&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">au</span> <span class="nb">InsertEnter</span> * <span class="k">silent</span> execute <span class="s2">&quot;!gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_shape ibeam&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">au</span> <span class="nb">InsertLeave</span> * <span class="k">silent</span> execute <span class="s2">&quot;!gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_shape block&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">au</span> <span class="nb">VimLeave</span> * <span class="k">silent</span> execute <span class="s2">&quot;!gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_shape block&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">endif</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Those of you using <code>gvim</code> might already have this, since the feature is builtin and might only need to be enabled.</p>

<p>If you use gnome-terminal in Linux, on the other hand, this is not natively supported, and it might be on your <em>nice-to-have</em> list, especially if you use tmux.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I finally managed to set up <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know what Octopress is, suffice it to say that it is a blogging tool that makes it easy to create blog posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and integrates seamlessly with <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.<br/>
What I like about it is its nice look, the github integration, but most importantly the fact that it makes it easy to create blog posts simply by opening my editor of choice, <code>vim</code>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been more of a sponge rather than a contributor (hence the blog name), so I&#8217;m just gonna go ahead and say that I most likely won&#8217;t be able to keep blogging for long.<br/>
I am also trying hard not transform this in a place where I rant endlessly because I already do enough of that in real life and that&#8217;s not an healthy habit.</p>

<p>I just want to use it to study a bunch of cool technologies, like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com">sass</a>, and the various flavours of markdown available: <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount">rdiscount</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet">redcarpet</a>, <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">kramdown</a>, <a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/">maruku</a>.<br/>
I can already see in the near future a style change: I like uniform color schemes where the main content has only a slight color difference than the background of the body, but then again I&#8217;m a fan of the <em>green-on-black</em> style of the unix console, so I might be biased.</p>
